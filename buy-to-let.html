        <div class="intro-text">
          Buy-to-let properties are real estate assets purchased primarily for the purpose of renting out to generate income, as opposed to owner occupancy. In Nairobi, this investment strategy has gained traction among both Kenyan nationals and foreign investors, driven by urbanization, a growing middle class, and a consistent influx of expatriates and professionals.
